{"id":"poker_solver_rust-cuk","title":"Remove deprecated texture config fields","description":"Remove num_flop_textures, num_turn_transitions, num_river_transitions, and ehs_samples from PostflopModelConfig. These are leftover from the old texture-based abstraction and are no longer used by any code path. Remove the fields, their default functions, serde annotations, and any references in sample YAML configs. Use #[serde(deny_unknown_fields)] or just let unknown fields fail naturally.","status":"in_progress","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"tyler.jennings@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-02-22T17:30:21Z","created_by":"tyler","updated_at":"2026-02-22T17:34:27Z"}
{"id":"poker_solver_rust-pe4","title":"Re-enable abstraction caching for StreetBuckets","description":"The abstraction cache was disabled during the StreetBuckets migration (trainer/src/main.rs). Update abstraction_cache.rs serialization to work with the new StreetBuckets data model instead of the old BoardAbstraction + HandBucketMapping. Re-enable cache loading in both the solve-preflop and hand-trace commands in trainer/src/main.rs. Verify round-trip: build → save → load → compare.","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"tyler.jennings@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-02-22T17:30:24Z","created_by":"tyler","updated_at":"2026-02-22T17:30:24Z"}
